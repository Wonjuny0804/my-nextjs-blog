Frontend dev's very interesting in my opinion. There's so much to learn, variety of challenges.

Because the requirements are so different. That being said, there's so many things to try out.

Probably people that are reading the post are already familiar with `Three.js` a powerful 3d rendering library on the web browser.

I was known it's existance for quite sometime now, but never have felt the need to learn it.

However since I've started publishing my posts and started looking for things to learn. I have decided this was going to be One
of the things I learned.

So here it goes. The `react-three-fiber` tryout.

### Following the tutorial

We should know that threejs came out not just for react. Since react has it's own rendering strategies we have to modify threejs codes to a `React based` code.

Which means, we'll have to create components and divide the code and write stuff using `JSX` which is the syntax `React` uses.

Hence, we'll be using `react-three-fiber`.

## Understanding the basic concepts of `Threejs`

If you're still unfamiliar to `React`, probably should checkout React first.

As for threejs. These `scene`, `camera`, `mesh`, `geometry`, `material` are the fundamentals to understand.

I didn't know the core concept of threejs, so let me elaborate.

There are somethings in Threejs for displaying "things" on the browser.

These elements are called `scene`, `camera`, `renderer`.

#### Essential things for displaying in Threejs

- scene
- camera
- renderer

Which means, in code term. In order to show something using Threejs there's always going to be
a scene, camera, renderer code inside it.

### Scene

Scene is where things are being displayed. You might say it's the background of the whole threejs rendering situation.

### camera

So camera object decide how the things that are displayed inside the scene are "seen". It decides the aspect ratio, if it feels near, far. tilted?
It's like controling the eyeball.

There are many type of cameras that threejs offers. Usually these cameras are created using generators and they require attributes.

1. field of View(FOV) => It's where you want to see(?) and the value is in degrees.
2. aspect ratio => decides the aspect ratio of what you see. In most cases you'd want to just use `window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight`
3. near => objects near than the value will not be rendered
4. far => objects further than value will not be rendered
